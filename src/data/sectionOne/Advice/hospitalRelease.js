        <h2>Managing your release from hospital</h2>
        <p>
          The doctor has made the decision to have you leave hospital. In this
          section I explain what the release process often looks like and what
          are some of the best things to do and watch for when you are being
          released.
        </p>
        <h2>The release process</h2>
        <p>It normally goes something like this</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have a meeting with a senior doctor or specialist (release
            meeting) to cover off questions and explain the reason for release.
          </li>
          <li>Paperwork is then filled in</li>
          <li>You pick up paper work</li>
          <li>You make your way home</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About after your stay in Hospital</h2>

        <p>
          Depending on your current symptoms and network how you are going to
          manage after hospital can be daunting. If you are concerned this
          should also be discussed in the release meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Usually on the day of your release you will have a meeting with a
          doctor. To help you with this is enclosed is a checklist, it may also
          be useful to have another person present in this meeting. Use a diary
          page to write down important questions before the meeting. You may or
          may not be told that this is going to happen so you will need to be
          prepared for it.
        </p>

        <h2>Release Meeting Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have chosen to have another person attend ensure you both
            know when its is schedules to occur
          </li>
          <li>
            After reading these pages write down all your questions so you are
            prepared for the meeting
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Release Meeting Questions</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Some example questions below</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can it is best to ensure your questions are written down and
          then you attempt to write down the answers as you talk to the doctor
          to ensure you don't forget.
