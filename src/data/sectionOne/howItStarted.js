        <h2>It started in an Ambulance... </h2>

        <p>
          Recently I found myself in an ambulance travelling across Thailand
          with a suspected heart attack. This was just the beginning of a
          journey which took me to three hospitals in three countries. At the
          same time my uncle was about to be released from hospital with a
          dangerous condition that only through his management of the situation
          was prevented.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was prepared to feel sick and scared about my illness, but was not
          prepared for a host of other difficulties I would experience while in
          hospital. After speaking with my uncle and others, I could see that
          the problems I experienced were shared by many.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
          The last thing I wanted to do was think through problems and create
          solutions while I was in hospital, but eventually I started to figure
          things out and get organised. As I progressed in setting up systems
          and managing things, management of my stay became much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have done the work, at least I know that next time my stay will
          much easier to manage. I hope others can benefit from my work as well.
          This is the reason I wrote this book.
